## Pixel-Perfect & Responsive Design
- All sections are built to match provided screenshots and videos as closely as possible.
- **Carousel and Ripple Effect** are fully mobile responsive:
  - Carousel switches to a stacked layout on small screens, with touch-friendly hover effects.
  - Ripple effect works on both mouse and touch events, resizing to fit mobile screens.
- The layout adapts to all device sizes, with custom breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## How to Use
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Use the navbar to jump to any feature section.
- Toggle light/dark mode with the button in the top right.
- Interact with the carousel, brand kits, and ripple effect for live demos.

## Notes
- No frameworks or build tools are used—just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- All animations and effects are custom-coded.
- For best results, use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
